# NLP Corona Tweeter Sentiment Analysis

In this project I will use machine learning techniques with text, and using math and statistics to get that text in a format that the machine learning algorithms can understand!

I will classify tweets into their sentiments whether its positive or negative based on the text content in 'OriginakTweet'. I will utilize the pipeline methods for more complex tasks. 

The dataset Corona_NLP_train.csv is available on kaggel, which contains 6 instances:

This dataset contains 40k+ records.
